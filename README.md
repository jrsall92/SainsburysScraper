Simply run the jar file with the url of the products page and optionally with a "true" or "false" second argument to 
enable/disable debug logging i.e. java -jar 
Arguments are validated, you can have a look in the main class for how that is done(com.jsalliaris.Application.java)

The project can be built with `./gradlew build` on Un*x or `gradlew.bat build` if on Windows.

This is a Java 8 app, but has been tested to run with Java 11 as well
